# Overview

# Business Understanding
Computing Vision, a major movie company, has seen other big companies create original films. They whave created a new movie studio to do the same. However, they do not have much experience creating original films. We have analyzed movie data to provide Computing Vision with business recommendations and insights that their stakeholders can leverage to create effective original films and stay on top of the industry.

# Data Understanding & Analysis
We are using the im.db and tn.movie_budgets.csv datasets. They provide extensive and useful data that can derive insights helpful to Computing Vision. A major limitation of our analysis was time, as our datasets were very large and we did not have as much time as we would have liked to clean and amalyze the data.

Business Recommendation #1:
We conducted an analysis to determine the most profitable genre of movies to create.

Business Recommendation #2:
We conducted an analysis to determine the amount of budget to use to increase revenue.

Business Recommendation #3:
We conducted an analysis to determine a release season that would yield more profitibility.

# Statistical Communication
Our null hypothesis stated that there is no difference between the seasonal release date and gross worldwide profits.
Our alternative Hypothesis stated that there is a difference between the seasonal release date and gross worldwide profits, the sample mean for gross worldwide profits is higher in the Spring & Summer seasons than Fall & Winter seasons.
We conducted a one-tailed Z-Test, with a significance level of 0.05 (95% confidence) that gross worldwide profits are higher during Spring & Summer. The Z-Score is 1.50, p-value is 0.065, putting movies released in Spring & Summer in the 93.94th percentile.
We fail to reject the null hypothesis, and therefore we cannot recommend a specific season to release movies. We speculate that Spring & Summer movie releases will lead to higher gross worlwide profits.
